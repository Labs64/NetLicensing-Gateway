# Labs64 NetLicensing / eCommerce Gateway

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Labs64/NetLicensing-Gateway.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Labs64/NetLicensing-Gateway)

[Labs64 NetLicensing](https://netlicensing.io) is a first-class solution in the Licensing as a Service (LaaS) sector. Based on open standards, it provides a cost effective, integrated and scalable platform for software vendors and developers who want to concentrate on their productâ€™s core functionality instead of spending resources on developing an own license management software.

## Docker Build and Deployment

Prerequisites:
* install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) on you host

To build the docker image execute:
```
$ docker image build -t labs64/gateway ./
```
Where `labs64` and `gateway` are _company_name_ and _app_image_name_.

### Use standalone container
```
$ docker container run -it --publish 8081:8080 labs64/gateway
```
Application can be accessed at [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)

If needed, to access the admin console. Run docker container with the following command.

Note: Tomcat user configuration is located in ./dockerfiles/conf/tomcat-users.xml

```
$ docker container run -it -v $(pwd)/dockerfiles/conf/tomcat-users.xml:/usr/local/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml --publish 8081:8080 labs64/gateway
```

### Use docker-compose (Tomcat + ngrok)

Start environment:
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

The ngrok monitoring endpoint can be accessed at [127.0.0.1:4040](http://127.0.0.1:4040)

Stop environment:
```
$ docker-compose down
```

### Sanity checks

To verify whether your local development environment is up and running open following URLs in your browser:

* localhost: http://localhost:8081/gateway/monitoring
* ngrok: http://ngrok-subdomain.ngrok.io/gateway/monitoring (Note: `ngrok-subdomain` might change on every environment start)
